# DesignPatterns-Java

Sample Project to understand important design patterns through programming exercises

**1) FacetedBuilder**

This project explains the concept of faceted Builder for piece wise object construction in java.

**Take Away :**

* Idea or pattern for implementing fluent builders

* Will help to recognise construct behind fluent builders in libraries when using them For ex : Retrofit / String builder uses a fluent builder construct for ease of implementation .

**2)Abstract Factory**

This project to explore the Factory pattern for whole sale creation of the objects

**Take Away:**

* This is pattern is mostly used as Factory Method i.e; Exposing a static method for object creation as constructors can be separated for same type in java by privatising the scope of constructor.

* Factory class is an extraction of factory methods

* How ever , Abstract factory is correspondence between hierarchy of objects and hierarchy of projects but quite rare to implement in day to day implementations.
